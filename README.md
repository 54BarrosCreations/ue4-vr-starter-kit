# ue4-vr-starter-kit
A Collection of VR-related c++ classes, implementable in blueprint. This is designed to serve as a basic template for basic systems in vr such as Locomotion, Laser Pointer Interaction, Gripping, and Networking. The implementation is simplistic in scope, but it can serve as a jumping off point to implementing your own custom systems.
